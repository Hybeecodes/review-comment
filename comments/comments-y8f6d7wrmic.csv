Ja'U Fired MEH,2019-10-21T14:29:39.000Z,none,"Hah! I prefer a Samsung Galaxy Note 10. At this time Google seems to be making their competition Apple and that's very bad. It's not jist uour video why I say this. But a lot of little cooksead up to my reason.  Google needs to focus in the real competition and nust let Apple keep doing it's own thing. Let's face it those phones are never going to be as great without Asian competitors. Now that Nokia has been crippled by Microsoft our Asian companies are on the top. For example Huawei has done so well our government has accused the company of spying on the USA when in actuality it's the USA government that tells our American tech companies to release transcripts on everyone using their products (spying). Samsung and Huawei have the best technology and these American companies only try to compete with camera's and small gimmicks. Why would I use a touchless swipe feature when I have a watch linked to my phone? I'll just use the watch (Galaxy Bitches) or even my wireless headset which also has a touch pad built into it #AnkerSoundCoreLibertyAir lol. The reality is unless you can completely talk toit and say turn off alarm you're going to grab your phone, and if theh doesn't want you to grab your phone then why make it a smartphone with a screen? I had this housephome back in 2001 that answered when I told it to and hung up when I told it to and here we are not with smartphones and this still doesn't exist thanks Microsoft who decided to ditch the surface and put the technology in a fucking gaming camera called kinect. The damn company purchased Nokia and never thought to add the surface feature to it, so stupid.",Nil
